Instagram OAuth image pull
--------------------------

A Zend backend app that requests a pull of the user's own Instagram images,
using Instagram's open authorization and picture API, given as assginments 2 and
3 for BCIT's COMP 4669 (Advanced Applications with PHP). The original
instructions can be found in `docs/`.

The assignment involved reverse-engineering the requests of a provided
Javascript frontend, then figuring out how to do open authorization and a pull
of a user's pictures via the official Instagram API SDK for PHP.
